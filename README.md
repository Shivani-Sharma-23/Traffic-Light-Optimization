# Traffic Light Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a speed optimization algorithm that helps vehicles catch every traffic light green. The algorithm calculates the optimal speed a vehicle should maintain to minimize stops and delays at traffic lights, thereby improving traffic flow and reducing travel time.

## Features

- **Optimal Speed Calculation**: Provides real-time speed recommendations to help drivers catch green lights at intersections.
- **Improved Traffic Flow**: Reduces the number of stops and starts, leading to smoother traffic movement and less congestion.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Promotes fuel savings by minimizing idling time at red lights.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows easy input of traffic light timings and road conditions for accurate speed optimization.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivani-Sharma-23/Traffic-Light-Optimization.git
   cd Traffic-Light-Optimization
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   Ensure Python is installed, then install the necessary packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Optimization Algorithm:**

   Execute the main script to start the speed optimization process:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
